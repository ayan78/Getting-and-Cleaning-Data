# Data Analysis
There are 5 tasks that are performed:
1. Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. Creates a new tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

# Output Files
 1. The final tidy data set is aclled TidyData.txt
 2. Github repository is https://github.com/ayan78/Getting-and-Cleaning-Data/ 
 3. A code book that describes the variables, the data, and transformations called CodeBook.md
 4. R script to reproduce the results is run_analysis.R
